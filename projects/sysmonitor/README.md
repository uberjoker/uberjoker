## sysmon - a simple system monitor for Haiku

### Aim of the project

sysmon is a test project, just a way to get my hands dirty on Haiku with a simple program. The program has the following features:
1. It will run on the command line
2. It will have a simple, terminal-based interface
3. Each time it is run, it will show the status of the following system parameters:
	1. The disk usage (free space, used space)
	2. RAM usage
	3. Processor Speeds
	4. Other standard details - current system time, name of the system, running duration etc.
4. At some point, would want to convert it into something like conky for Haiku
