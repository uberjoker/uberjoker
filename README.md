I'm currently trying to get working on getting started with simple programs for Haiku OS. The first 'trial' program I am working on is sysmon - a simple system monitor utiity for the command line, which eventually may become something like conky.

In paralle, I am also trying to work on an app to organise photos - a desktop app.
